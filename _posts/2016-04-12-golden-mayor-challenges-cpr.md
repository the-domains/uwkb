"This letter is to inform you that our community, Golden, BC, expects to be paddling the Lower Canyon of the Kicking Horse River this May long weekend as part of our Annual Mountain Festival," Mayor Ozust said in his letter. "It is our expectation that CP Rail will return to its role of good corporate citizen and community partner and come back to the table with a solution that ensures our access to this very important community asset. 

"Mr. Harrison, do the right thing. Solve this problem. Stop this standoff between your company and the community of Golden.
"The citizens of the Golden and area will continue this battle, locally, nationally and internationally, and we are up to the fight. We have the historical agreements in place and legal support for those agreements. We have done our homework concerning other similar crossings across the country and we know that a solution can be easily reached.
"We know that there is an alternate crossing option, along with administrative and engineering solutions that can mitigate the risk.
"And we know that this should be a good news story for CP Rail; a story where a big company with a long history in a small community does the right thing.
